# Kaggle Kernels

This repository contains kernels written for the competitions and for learning new features/skills on Kaggle platform. The kernels will be divided by:

1. Algorithms
2. Data Analysis
3. Interesting Architectures

## Algorithms:

Kernels in this folder focuses on the various ways of using algorithms like: logistic regression, SVM, k-means etc. 

Here is the list of algorithms along with links:

## Data Analysis:

Kernels in this folder focuses on the various ways in which you can analyze the data before you start a machine learning project. Some examples of data analysis are: 
- basic statistical calculations ( mean, variance, median )
- complex charting of variables using libraries like `seaborn`
- feature engineering based on data analysis 

## Interesting Architectures:

Kernels in this folder focuses on the various architectures that have been created by other folks. Some interesting architctures that I have found so far are:
- bi-directional LSTM's with auto-encoders 
- CUDA implementations of LSTM's
- LSTM implementation for signal processing
